# Java Programming Educational
Learning Java programming 

# Repository will be focused on learning Java and it's fundamentals 

First project pushed was a traditional "Hello World"

# Primitive Data Types     
<p>byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive)</p>
<p>int: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1.</p>
<p>long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer.</p>
<p>float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point</p>
<p>double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.</p>
<p>boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false.</p>
<p>char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.</p>

# Switch Cases 

<p>Swith(variable){ </p>
<p>  case 1: </p>
<p>    //code </p>
<p>    break; </p>
<p>  case 2: </p>
<p>    //code </p>
<p>    break; </p>
} </p>

# For Loop

<p>for (int i = 0; i <= j; i++){</p>
<p>  //code can be enter here </p>
<p>}</p>

# While Loop 

while (variable condition){
  //code is entered here;
  //Use a break for cases where the loop should stop
  // do while loops the first condition will have to stop
}
